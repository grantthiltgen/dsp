[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

*Exercise 1   Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to summarize what you learned about whether first babies arrive late.

*Which summary statistics would you use if you wanted to get a story on the evening news? Which ones would you use if you wanted to reassure an anxious patient?

*Finally, imagine that you are Cecil Adams, author of The Straight Dope (http://straightdope.com), and your job is to answer the question, “Do first babies arrive late?” Write a paragraph that uses the results in this chapter to answer the question clearly, precisely, and honestly.






*Exercise 2   In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named chap02ex.ipynb; open it. Some cells are already filled in, and you should execute them. Other cells give you instructions for exercises. Follow the instructions and fill in the answers.

*A solution to this exercise is in chap02soln.ipynb




*In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named chap02ex.py; you can use this file as a starting place for the following exercises. My solution is in chap02soln.py.
*Exercise 3   The mode of a distribution is the most frequent value; see http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics). Write a function called Mode that takes a Hist and returns the most frequent value.





*As a more challenging exercise, write a function called AllModes that returns a list of value-frequency pairs in descending order of frequency.
*Exercise 4   Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohen’s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?
